# Reflections on the Project
Comp220 @ Capilano U - Map ADT class collaboration project (2019)

## Meeting Project Requirements / Code Correctness
 - were students able to complete the project / does their code produce correct results?

_What was missing?
  - are there any unresolved issues or missing components? 

## Code Quality
  - does code follow Comp220 style guide?  Are all interaces properly documented?

## Teamwork and Communications
Good teamwork and communications skills make up at least 50% of project success.
A large part of this project is about learning new tools and techniques
for working in a team (IDE, Version Control System, Issues board, Slack, ...).

 - were students able to learn to apply tools and communicate effectively about project?

## Work Sharing
On any team project, work is never distributed evenly.
There are always those who take leadership roles, and those more comfortable following.
Those who do more than their fair share of the heavy lifting, and those willing to ride coat tails of others.

  - did students make an effort to ensure they took on a fair share of the work?
  - did students contribute to both the code and the project management / communications?
